# Reflections

Individual:
<br>
<br>•	what do I want to learn or understand better?
<br>•	how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
<br>•	what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
<br>•	what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

Team:
<br>
<br>• Social contract
<br>• Success criteria for the teams (what do we want to achieve with our application) 
<br>• Three KPIs we use for monitoring our progress
<br>• Roles in our team
<br>• Relation to litterature and guest lectures
<br>
<br>• The chosen scope of the application under development, including priority of features and for whom you are creating value
<br>• Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom
<br>• The design of your application
<br>• The behavioral overview of your application (for example through use cases, interaction diagrams) 
<br>• The structural overview of your application(domain model)
<br>• Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation
<br>• Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs
<br>
<br>• The agile practices you have used for the current sprint
<br>• The time you have spent on the course
<br>• The sprint review(either in terms of the outcome of the current week’s exercise or meeting the product owner
best practices for using new tools and technologies
