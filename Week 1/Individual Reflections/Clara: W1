•	what do I want to learn or understand better?
  We are in the beginning phase of the project, and therefore the first thing I would like to know more about is the scrum model. 
  If we work in a good and structured way it’s more likely that the project outcome will be good and structured. 
  So the first step is to develop this knowledge. 

•	how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  By discussing relevant subjects (such as scrum, how to create an app etc.) together with the other team members all of us will obtain a deeper understanding. 
  At this early phase, I will also try to find relevant literature to share with my team. 
  
•	what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
  My contribution is to study literature, and to familiarize myself with the different platforms that we are about to use. 
  I have not been in Gothenburg this week, so I have tried my best to deliver from distance and access knowledge on my own. 
  
•	what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
  Since it is the first week we haven’t delivered that much yet, and no code for sure. The first step was to find group members, followed by trying to figure out what to do, to create accounts at Trello, 16 topics, Slack and Github etc. for the future work. 
  I was not able to attend the classes, since I was skiing in Åre, but I kept in contact with the group anyway during the whole week. Yesterday we had a skype meeting where we went through our team reflection, set up to dos’ and planned the next week.
