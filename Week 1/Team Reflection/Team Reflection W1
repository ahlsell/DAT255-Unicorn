Social contract:
This week we have started the social contract and talked about the desired outcome, success criterias, 
and how we want to work and what to think about in order to work agile. Whats important to reflect upon
is the purpose of the social contract - why did we make it. The purpose with the social contract is to
measure expectations and create a solid base for the project, make sure that everyone is aligned. 

Success criteria for the teams (what do we want to achieve with our application):

Three KPIs we use for monitoring our progress:
When coming up with relevant KPIs our strategy was to break down the process and see what brings us forward. 

Our conclusion was to measure three things:
-How much do we produce each week and the metric for that is the quantity of code.
-It is also important that we not only produce code but make sure it is good and works and to measure that
we wanted to look at the metric quality of code and measure by Findbugs and user-testing. 
-Last but not least we want every team member to participate equally much so the third KPI is individual
contribution.

Roles in our team:
At this stage, it was hard to decide roles since we do not have a full group yet. Hopefully we can talk more about
roles next week. We have looked into the strutture of SCRUM teams and usually you need a scrum master, scrum 
team and scrum product owner.

The design of your application:
Since we don’t know the brief and haven’t started the product development we cannot comment on this. 

The behavioral overview of your application (for example through use cases, interaction diagrams): 
Since we don’t know the brief and haven’t started the product development we cannot comment on this.


The structural overview of your application(domain model):
We aim to have a good structure and use the knowledge we gathered in previous courses to use a good framework,
e-r diagram and a good design pattern for the code. 

Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation:

Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs:
Is related to one of our KPIs so we will definitely work with this throughout the process.

The time you have spent on the course:
Since a lot of the team-members were away this week the work has been divided and not equally distributed.
Next week we will hopefully have a better structure.

The sprint review(either in terms of the outcome of the current week’s exercise or meeting the product owner:
The LEGO workshop was a good introduction to scrum however it is difficult to grasp the overall picture during
that amount of time. But everyone look forward to learn more about the SCRUM methodology.
