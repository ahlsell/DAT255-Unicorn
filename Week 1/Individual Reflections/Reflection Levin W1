What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to understand and grasp the project better. Right now it feels a bit unclear what is going to be done and how. I guess it will clear up with time. In the meantime, I want to learn to use the tools and models relevant for the course. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By learning how to use available tools such as atom, scribble, GitHub desktop etc. and determine which tools to use for our project I can help the team, and therefore myself to make progress.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Primarily through attending to lectures and exercises. Helping setting up scrum board on trello and to do’s. Will spread what I’ve learned.

Current situation & learning objectives:
Right now we are trying to structure the project. We have done this by creating means of communication, social contracts, KPI’s, setting up Github and trello etc. 
Objectives for next week:
-	Grasp the project
-	Understand and implement SCRUM efficiently 
-	Get done with administrative stuff
